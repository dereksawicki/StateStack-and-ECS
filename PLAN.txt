Purpose: learn about state management. 
Project Goal: A program that begin in a menu state. The use can manuever through various screens. 
              On entering the game state, there is a loading screen transition. Once in the game
		      state, there will be a series of 'play states', the user can pause at any time, 
			  return to menu, restart. Game must have a start up phase, rounds, a game over phase.
			  Should be able to set controls in options and pause menu
			  Game will be a pong (maybe with variations)
